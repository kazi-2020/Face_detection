# Face_detection

This is a program that detects the faces in the images provided to the input of the program.
The detection of the faces are done using openCV. Once the face is detected, it outlines the face and displays the name under it.
Haar cascades are used to train the detection algorithm.
RGB to grayscale convertion of the images are done using matrix multiplication
